# About this application
This is the clone of the SoftUser application which contains a login form and and a dashboard. When valid credentials are provided in the login form, the dashboard is accessed by the user where there is a bottom navigation bar with three menu items. In the first menu item 'Home' the added students are displayed. Firstly, there are three users when the dashboard is accessed for the first time. Similarly, another menu item 'Add Student' contains a registration form where the details are provided and student are created. Thus, the created students are appended to the list contained in the 'Home' menu item along with the previous users. Moreover, 'About Us' fragment shows the web view of the Softwarica College Website. Also, the particular student can be removed from the list by clicking the trash icon button placed in the top right corner of each student details(recycler view item).
